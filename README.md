## 🤖 Introduction

**Grey Matter** is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate the discovery of top-tier researchers from Bangladesh and provide detailed insights into academic journals worldwide.  
Developed using **React JS**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Express JS**, and **Vite**, this website serves as an essential tool for novice researchers, academic professionals, students, and researchers seeking to connect with influential figures in their fields or explore journals by various key metrics.  

Whether you're looking to collaborate with leading researchers or find journals that align with specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), **Grey Matter** offers a streamlined, user-friendly experience.

## 🎨 Inspiration

The idea behind **Grey Matter** was inspired by the need to bridge the gap between researchers in Bangladesh and the global academic community.  

Upon stepping into the vast world of research, many become clueless. There are no visible guidelines on the *Know-How's* of research, no dedicated platform to learn about journals and conferences, and no resource to highlight Bangladesh’s top academic minds. They remain in the shadows.  

We said **NO** to this lack of visibility and created **Grey Matter** to bring these minds into the limelight. We aim to close the knowledge gap and eliminate the feeling of hopelessness that often plagues early-stage researchers.
